drc-fir
=======

A github fork of Denis Sbragion's amazing room equalization toolkit.

Copyright (C) 2002-2011 Denis Sbragion.  
Gitification and minor build fixes (C) 2017 Jörn Nettingsmeier.

You can contact the original author at <d.sbragion@infotecna.it>.

For problems with this particular fork, please use the github 
issue tracker or contact <nettings@stackingdwarves.net>.

All the documentation for DRC is under the [doc
subdirectory](https://rawgit.com/nettings/drc-fir/master/doc/drc.html).

The official DRC home page (now slightly out of maintenance) is at
<http://drc-fir.sourceforge.net>.

The reason for this fork is not to usurp a great piece of software,
but rather to make my own compile fixes available to others and 
serve as a patch collection point between releases. If you like this software,
please write to Denis. If you wish to make a donation to the original
author, you can do so at his
[sourceforge project page](http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=136217).
I will try to get the fixes collected here upstream every once in a while, 
so that this fork doesn't take on a life of its own. Contributions are
welcome.
