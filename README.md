You can contact the original author at <d.sbragion@infotecna.it>.

For problems with this particular fork, please use the github 
issue tracker or contact <nettings@stackingdwarves.net>.

All the documentation for DRC is under the [doc subdirectory](doc/drc.html).

The official DRC home page (now slightly out of maintenance) is at
<http://drc-fir.sourceforge.net>.

The reason for this fork is not to usurp a great piece of software,
but rather to make my own compile fixes available to others and 
prevent drc-fir from succumbing to bit-rot. If you like this software,
please write to Denis. If you wish to make a donation to the original
author, you can do so at his
[http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=136217](sourceforge project
page).
I will try to get my fixes upstream every once in a while, so that this fork
doesn't take on a life of its own.
